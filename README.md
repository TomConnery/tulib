# tulib
Tulib is an extension library for ComputerCraft. It was written with the intention of reducing boilerplate-code and adding useful functionality whilst keeping complexity for third-parties on a minimum.

The current status of the project is **very early ALPHA**, meaning that **it will likely not work on your machine and no support is given yet**
